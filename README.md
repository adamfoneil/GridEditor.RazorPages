This is something I've used internally forever in some version or another for implementing inline table editing. I know there are much more polished and capable table editors out there, but they rely on JavaScript. I like to do stuff in Razor where possible, and in the very simplest way possible.

To use this:
- install nuget package **GridEidtor.RazorPages**
- in your Razor page, reference 

Rather than give a step-by-step
